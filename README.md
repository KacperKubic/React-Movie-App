<h1>React Movie App</h1>
<hr><p>Movie App made with React.js and CSS<br/>
It displays the popular, best rated and upcomming movies. It also allows the user to search for movies, add them to favourite, to watch or watched list.</br> 
I used TMDB (The Movie Database) API to make all the API requests.<br/>
During the development of this project I learned a lot of things such us: creating my own custom hook, fetching the data from third party API, using local storage with react. </p>
